introduction_ff9ab9a2		We had to push the damn thing all the way into town. It was hot, dusty, and way too bright for someone who had just woken up in the back of an RV.	game/script.rpy	48
introduction_a5cad58d		Norman took it in stride, as he does with most things. To him, a breakdown is just another adventure on the road trip. He’s always had that optimism.	game/script.rpy	49
introduction_d9857bb2		His chipper demeanor faded into something of confusion once he popped the hood and immediately saw why the van was no longer running.	game/script.rpy	50
introduction_804b9421		The entire thing was overgrown with plant life.	game/script.rpy	51
introduction_c00913c7		Right now, the van is sitting on Main Street, along with me and Norman, drenched in sweat. The sun is high in the sky and beating down hard.	game/script.rpy	54
introduction_6e55f392		Norman turns to me, a smile on his face in spite of his clear exhaustion, and breathes in relief.	game/script.rpy	55
introduction_7f518341	n	"Are you as hungry as I am right now?"	game/script.rpy	58
introduction_197cbcc7		I am pretty hungry, I notice. I had been too busy pushing the van to realise until now.	game/script.rpy	59
introduction_928eef8b	player	"Yeah, actually. We didn’t get a chance to grab breakfast."	game/script.rpy	60
introduction_41085321		Norman scans the street slowly, frowning.	game/script.rpy	61
introduction_f8be2a4c	n	"I’ll see if I can find somewhere we can get some food."	game/script.rpy	62

introduction_ce254173	n	"How about you see the mechanic about it. I'll find us some food."	game/script.rpy	66

introduction_ca851ec3	n	"I’ll try to find a local map too!"	game/script.rpy	68
introduction_fca57001		With that, he’s gone, and I’m left alone.	game/script.rpy	71
introduction_95263388		The air inside the garage is thick with the smell of oil. It’s almost hard to breathe.	game/script.rpy	74
introduction_23f9e026		I hear music from a cassette player on one of the many shelves that line the walls. The only other noise is that of the mechanic himself at work underneath a jacked up car.	game/script.rpy	75
introduction_49246eac		All I can see of him are his legs, and occasionally his hand reaching for a new tool. He hums to the chorus of the song playing.	game/script.rpy	76
introduction_a344caad		He pushes himself out from underneath the car and sits up to wipe his forehead, still tapping his foot to the music. He notices me standing there, and stands to greet me with a smile on his face.	game/script.rpy	77
introduction_66584da2		His hair is short, messy and slick with motor oil. From the various patches sewn clumsily onto his jumpsuit, it’s clear that he’s a fan of science fiction.	game/script.rpy	80
introduction_4597ecad		He cleans off his glasses and leans against the car, still smiling at me.	game/script.rpy	81

introduction_0bccc6f8	player	"My friend and I actually had our van break down outside of town…"	game/script.rpy	83
introduction_34dd3a1b		I hesitate. How do I even explain something like this?	game/script.rpy	84
introduction_31dce6fc	player	"We have a... uh... Strange problem."	game/script.rpy	85
introduction_81e66694		Mike chuckles and gestures to the door behind me.	game/script.rpy	86

introduction_f96bffdb	player	"Uhh... I have no idea. It just appeared."	game/script.rpy	101
introduction_32ac9c96	m	"That... Huh. Okay?"	game/script.rpy	102
introduction_337eb6be	m	"I guess I can see how bad the damage is and remove as much as I can. This isn't going to be a quick job though."	game/script.rpy	103
introduction_5972a268	player	"Yeah, I figured..."	game/script.rpy	104
introduction_2525d7b5		Mike closes the hood and flashes me a smile.	game/script.rpy	105
introduction_298161be	m	"Well. I'll try to clear this out. I reckon it'll take a few days but I'll try."	game/script.rpy	106
introduction_50cc7ea6	m	"There's a motel right across the street if you're looking for a place to stay. The owners are good friends of mine."	game/script.rpy	107
introduction_466c84df	player	"I guess I'll go check it out. Thanks Mike."	game/script.rpy	108
introduction_91fdfd61		The motel lobby is way too brightly lit. The decoration in here is tacky, and it’s clear they don’t get a lot of business.	game/script.rpy	113
introduction_2bd142ab		Behind the front desk sits a woman with brown hair and light eyes who doesn’t look like she wants to be there at all.	game/script.rpy	114
introduction_a5875f31		She’s flipping through a magazine absentmindedly. I don’t think she’s even noticed I’m here yet.	game/script.rpy	115

introduction_c5473c38		Yes she has.	game/script.rpy	119
introduction_c537d573	player	"Uh. I'm looking for a room."	game/script.rpy	120

introduction_84a93106	unknown	"Our rates are listed here. Sign here and I'll get you a key."	game/script.rpy	122
introduction_2c9e9ae1		I get a room with two beds. The woman hands me a key and picks up her magazine again.	game/script.rpy	123
introduction_8b35b53c	l	"Thanks. I'm Liz. If you need anything I'm usually here. If not, my brother runs the gift store next door."	game/script.rpy	124
introduction_ca3cf930		When I turn to leave, I find myself bumping into someone on their way in.	game/script.rpy	131

introduction_9dba250b		He seems to notice my lack of recognition and continues.	game/script.rpy	139
introduction_27bd8834	k	"Locals think there’s some kind of monster breaking everything in town. It’s probably just some kid but you know how small communities are."	game/script.rpy	140
introduction_499cdc40		That’s when I notice a small face peek out from behind him.	game/script.rpy	141
introduction_1833bb55		Trailing along behind the detective is a young girl who peers up at me cautiously, clutching firmly onto him. Kessler glances down at her.	game/script.rpy	144
introduction_500ca87f	k	"This is Julie, she’s my daughter."	game/script.rpy	145
introduction_4037a491	j	"... Hi."	game/script.rpy	146
introduction_3c23170d		Julie tugs on his pants leg urgently, signalling that she does not want to be here right now. The detective sighs and ruffles her hair.	game/script.rpy	147
introduction_6cc84bf1	k	"I better get moving."	game/script.rpy	148
introduction_5f78edee		He grumbles to himself and moves past me, toward the rooms.	game/script.rpy	149
introduction_ad2e272d	k	"Be seeing you."	game/script.rpy	150
introduction_49f15fd4		With that, I’m left in the motel lobby with Liz again, who has evidently not been paying attention to our exchange and doesn’t seem to care.	game/script.rpy	151
introduction_05d4c604		I might as well check out the gift store while I'm here.	game/script.rpy	156
introduction_b65b3741		The souvenirs that line the shelves look like they've been here for months. There's a layer of dust coating each one.	game/script.rpy	159
introduction_16e6d6dd		Behind the desk sits a man who has fallen asleep in his wheelchair. Like the main section of the motel, this gift shore doesn't seem to get much business.	game/script.rpy	160
introduction_591f3c74		I clear my throat and make my presence known. The man jolts awake and his eyes light up at the sight of a potential customer.	game/script.rpy	161

introduction_a7cc5d23	s	"Pleasure to meet you! It's rare to see fresh faces in Coyote Creek... It's a shame, really. This town has a lot of charm."	game/script.rpy	168
introduction_c425c81b		He glances back at the objects on display and frowns.	game/script.rpy	169
introduction_fe7193a4	s	"... It really is an underrated place."	game/script.rpy	170
introduction_1b8e90a3		He snaps out of it and looks back at me, his smile returning to his face.	game/script.rpy	171
introduction_881db177	s	"I hope you like it here. Feel free to drop by whenever you want. I've always got time."	game/script.rpy	172
introduction_0eb6f3f6		Pushing the van took a lot of energy, so Norman and I spent the rest of the day relaxing.	game/script.rpy	176
introduction_8bd9905d		Mike says it could take up to a week to fix, so it looks like we're stuck here for a while.	game/script.rpy	177

monday_0006aaec	n	"Y'know what? Alright. I'll be there. Get up whenever you're ready."	game/script.rpy	198
monday_b211bb67		Before I have a chance to reply, he hurries out of the room and closes the door behind him.	game/script.rpy	201

sunday_737566e2	n	"I'd like that..."	game/script.rpy	282
sunday_3c30046f		We sit in the van for a moment just to enjoy eachother's company. Eventually, Norman grins and pulls out his keys.	game/script.rpy	283
sunday_0b66df6f	n	"So... Moment of truth?"	game/script.rpy	284
sunday_90fc4b7a		The engine sounds perfect. Norman laughs in excitement.	game/script.rpy	285
sunday_eff0ccbe	n	"Time to go home then!"	game/script.rpy	286
sunday_a563a4ad		He releases the handbrake, shifts into gear, and begins to pull away from Coyote Creek.	game/script.rpy	287
sunday_993ddffd		The town gets smaller in the mirror. My heart aches for a moment, leaving behind this place that feels so special to us.	game/script.rpy	288
